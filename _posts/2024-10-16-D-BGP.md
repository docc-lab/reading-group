Research Question: What are the challenges to "evolving" (incrementally deploying improvements to) internet routing protocol(s) like BGP, and how can those challenges be overcome?

_(Meta-Question: What lessons can be learned by taking this paper as an exemplar of a well-stated intro/background/motivation?)_

Key Contributions:

- Provide a well-motivated and reasoned statement of the requirements on _any_ possible solution to the problem of inter-domain routing evolvability
- Distill these requirements into a minimal feature set
- Present Darwin's BGP (D-BGP), a protocol that builds on BGP and embodies these features 
- Evaluation of D-BGP:
  - cheapness of implementation 
  - simulation showing better adoption rate for D-BGP

This paper states the following problems with BGP (reasons why you'd want to evolve):

- Domains have no strong mechanism to limit their traffic load
- Single best-effort path selection is mandated, leaving performance on the table (alternates might be preferred by some domaisn)
- Easy to attack:
  - Prefix hijacking
  - Traffic interception (black-holing, interdiction)
- "Architectural Rigidity"
  - Neighbors are required to use the same protocol, which precludes the possibility of some defecting by choosing a different/better protocol
  - (Bug or Feature?) "\[BGP\] has depressed ISP's ability to sell value-added services, such as differentiated QoS or alternate paths, to combat their ever-increasing commoditization." _Commentary: Isn't this just net-neutrality?  Whic is a "good thing?"  Is commoditization (i.e., competition-driven downward price pressure) good for consumers, if not producers?_

**Key Insight:**  Solving any or even all of these problems with a new protocol, without addressing the root causes of lack-of-evolvability, will simply result in a new protocol that frustrates future efforts to evolve/improve. _I.e., Evolvability is actually the meta-feature to improve!_

Motivtion (2) structure:

1. Narrative describing the structure of the present/future state
   - Introduces terminology: Islands, Gulfs, Mulit-Network-Protocol-Headers, Baseline Protocol, Routing Compliance (gets its own section?)
   - States the basis for generalization: 
     - 14 (!) recently-proposed protocol improvements designed to mitigate specific problems
     - These will be sorted into "evolvability scenarios"
     - Each evolvability scenario produces a few requirements
     - The requirements are further affinitized into features
     - _"use cases" -> generalized scenarios -> requirements -> features_
       - _specificity -> generality -> specificity -> generality_
2. The scenarios:
  1. baseline -> baseline w./critical fix
     Requires:
       - (CF-R1) Disseminate critical fixes' control information across gulfs
       - (CF-R2) Disseminate critical fixes' control information in-band of baseline's advertisements
  2. baseline -> baseline (in parallel with) custom protocol
     Requires:
       - (CP-R3) Facilitate across-gulf discovery of islands running custom protocols and how to negotiate use of their services
  3. baseline -> replacement protocol
     Requires:
       - (G-R4) Inform islands and gulf ASes of what protocols are used on routing paths
       - (G-R5) Avoid loops across all protocols used on routing paths
3. The features:
  - Pass-through support: (CF-R1)
  - Multi-protocol data structure: (G-R4, CP-R3, CF-R2, G-R5)

Questions for Discussion:

- How might the addition of new use cases (14+n) change the scenarios, requirements, and features?
- How universal is the 4-step progression followed in this paper's motivation?  How might it apply to a problem you're working on?
