layout: post

This discussion introduced 7 presentations that we attended during ATC, serving as a sampler to choose future selections for the reading group papers. These papers are closely aligned with DOCC Labâ€™s agenda on debugging distributed systems. Among the seven research projects, Nodens aligns most closely with our current research direction. It identified a gap within the field of microservice management, highlighting that most tools are reactive, resulting in long Quality of Service (QoS) recovery times. Their research question addresses how to develop a proactive approach to reduce QoS recovery time. The main contributions include the proposal of a traffic-based load monitor and a blocking-aware load updater as solutions. They tested their approach using 200 microservice applications with 10 call graphs, simulating Alibaba's production environment and datasets. Future work could involve examining their solutions to improve upon their design decisions.
