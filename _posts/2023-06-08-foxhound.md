Foxhound: Server-grade Observability for Network-augmented Applications (EuroSys'23) presents a distributed tracing system that extends to the network, providing visibility into previously unseen portions of end-to-end request workflows. Foxhound has two types of annotations that can be used to instrument a PDP: `store` and `stats` which allow you to create a span or collect aggregate metrics. 

We discussed how this seems to put more responsibility on developers to 1) learn a new tracing framework (foxhound queries and annoations), 2) instrument the PDPs with this framework and 3) interpret potentially more complex traces (not all spans for a trace id seem to be collected with the same probability, resulting in incomplete traces).
