Foxhound: Server-grade Observability for Network-augmented Applications (EuroSys'23) presents a distributed tracing system that extends to the network, providing visibility into previously unseen portions of end-to-end request workflows. Foxhound has two types of annotations that can be used to instrument a PDP: `store` and `stats` which allow you to create a span or collect aggregate metrics.
